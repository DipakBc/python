'''
a = 1 #a == Variblea and data type is == int. 

b = "Deepak" #b == Variable and data type is == str.

c = True #c == Variable and data type is == Boolean.

d = None #d == Variable and data type is == None type.

e = 1.1 #e == Variable and data type is == Float.

f = complex(1, 3) #f == Variable and data type is == Complex.


print(a)

print(type(a))

print(b)
print(type(b))

print(c)
print(type(c))

print(d)
print(type(d))

print(e)
print(type(e))

print(f)
print(type(f))
